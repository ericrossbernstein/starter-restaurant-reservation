# **Periodic Tables:** Restaurant Reservation System

## Summary

This web application was created as my capstone project for Thinkful's Engineering Flex Program. The prompt called for the development of a React app, Node + Express server, and PostgreSQL database for Periodic Tables, a fictional startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants. The software is meant to be used only by the restaurant personnel when a customer calls to request a reservation. Periodic Tables allows users to create and edit a reservation, list all reservations for a particular date, search for reservations by mobile number, create a new table, seat a reservation by assigning it to a particular table, free up a table by finishing a reservation, and cancel a reservation. The original assignment and user stories can be found at Thinkful's [original repo](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-restaurant-reservation).
